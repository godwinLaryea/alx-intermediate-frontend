# Installation of SASS can be seen at the official SASS website

### Installation via CLI

      npm install -g sass


The above downloads the package using node package manager and installs it globally so it can be used directly from the command line. 

If newer versions exist, further instructions will be given to update to the latest version 
with an additional command. Example
      
      npm install sass -v 3.7.4

Check if installations has been done correct using:
      
      sass --version
